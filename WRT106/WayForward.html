            <p>Regulations have been created regarding trawling on both the state and federal levels within the United States. These regulations limit areas, timeframes, and equipment that is allowed to be used for trawling. Regulations such as these will ensure that the practice trends toward and remains sustainable.</p>

            <p>If no changes are made to this outdated practice, it will contribute in large part to the destruction of fish populations predicted by scientists. The large amount of discards produced by trawling leads other fishing methods in the destruction of otherwise renewable resources. Some studies suggest that the oceans may even be empty of fish as early as 2048 (Ritchie and Roser).</p>
