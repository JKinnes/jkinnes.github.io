            <p>Due to trawl fishing, some marine species have seen devastating declines in population over the past few decades. The act of bottom trawling not only catches ‘bycatch’ species that are unintentionally gathered alongside the target species, but the path of the trawl displaces all the flora and fauna they pass over.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For example, when the sand at the bottom of the ocean is displaced by bottom trawling, it can reduce the buoyancy of cod eggs during their gestation period which can greatly impact their reproductive success. It made such an impact that prolonged exposure reduced the successful cod reproductive rate to under 1/5th of eggs who were not exposed to the displaced sand from bottom trawling (Corell et al. 1).</p>
            <br>
            <p>This overly efficient method of fishing has caused a decline in fish populations in many parts of the world and more rules and regulations need to be put in place to heavily restrict and prevent this marine carnage.</p>

            <p>"Bycatch is another leading problem in trawl fishing. Bycatch is the accidental capture of any non-targeted species that can range from endangered or threatened species to juvenile fish that have not yet had a chance to reproduce. Bycatch jarringly disrupts any ecosystem it occurs in as it removes species that are critical to their ecosystem."</p>
