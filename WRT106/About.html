            <p>Bottom trawling is a fishing practice that herds and captures large amounts of specimens to collect a single target species. It is accomplished by towing a large net behind the boat and along the ocean floor, and it is the most popular fishing method used today. Trawling is not only used as a fishing method, but also as a surveying method to collect mass amounts of data from underwater ecosystems.

            <p>Trawling is accomplished by setting floats atop the head rope and trawl opening which create a roof for the fish to be caught beneath. Ships use special gear attached to the footrope to create the opening. The ‘fishing circle’ is created by the head and foot ropes attached to the main ‘sweeps’.</p>

            <p>The efficiency of trawling is also its downfall as the large nets destroy ecosystems and capture many bycatch species, heavily raising mortality rates</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Trawling was a necessary evil when fishing was heavily depended on for survival, however now that human survival isn't dependant on efficient fishing techniques, these drawbacks aren't reasonable</li>
              <li>Trawl fishing devastates the seafloor, damaging essential flora and fauna</li>
              <li>Trawling accounts for nearly 60% of all fish discarded after being caught (Cashion et al. 60)</li>
