This repository is intended for use as a foundation for Joshua Kinnes's website files for URI CSC 106, Spring Semester 2023. If you are a current student of CSC 106, see the below quoted policy on academic integrity from the course syllabus.

As stated in the course syllabus and day one lecture regarding academic integrity:

"Assignments are to be the result of your individual efforts, unless you are told otherwise. It is easy to copy material on the computer; such copying constitutes plagiarism. We employ software to check for code plagiarism and the teaching staff actively evaluates student work to determine if it has occurred. See the University Manual for more information about the potential consequences of cheating. https://web.uri.edu/manual/chapter-8/chapter-8-2/.

"For programming: While you may discuss general solutions and algorithms with classmates, you are not allowed to: 
● share code with other students 
● look at any other student’s code 
● use code provided to you by anyone else 
● use code that you find on the Internet.

"If you use code that has been provided for you by the instructor, or that you have used in a prior assignment, include in your comments where the code came from, and describe how the code works. If you ever have a question about what is acceptable when working on a programming assignment, please contact your instructor"
