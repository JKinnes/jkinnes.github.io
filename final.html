     		Below is an embedded instance of myself and Chloe Tworek's final project for CSDC 106. The program aims to inspire high school students attending the presentation to learn more about coding and programming by asking coding related questions and leading them to other tables in search of answers. In order to utilize the program, a user must enter words corresponding  to each image found on the main page. These words are "Variable", "Array", "Comment", "Conditional", and "Boolean", respectively. Once the correct word is entered, the student must answer a question relating to the word itself. Once all questions were answered, they were able to approach the table with the end screen shown and claim a prize.
